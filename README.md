I am thankful to @zigurous for generously sharing this project. As an AI & DS student, it provided me with a fantastic opportunity to put into practice the knowledge I have gained in school. My objective was to develop an intelligent agent capable of effectively controlling the dino to avoid obstacles and achieve a high score. To accomplish this, I used the ml-agents library for agent training. You can find the pretrained model included in this repository, conveniently located in the `nnModels` folder. Additionally, I have captured a brief video showcasing the agent's performance in the game, but please note that with further training, the agent's capabilities will surpass what is demonstrated in the current video.
